### ðŸ§± Technical Plan

#### Components Involved

- `LyricsViewer.vue`: Entry point, shows search button
- `LyricsEditorForm.vue`: Edit, Confirm, Cancel, Reset
- `LyricsGenerator.vue`: Search, Select
- `lyricsService.ts`: Fetches from LRCLib API
- `ExternalMetadataController.php` : Fetches metadata from external sources (LRCLib, anidb, imdb)
- `MetadataController.php`: Saves lyrics to metadata (use existing function)

#### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/metadata/:id/import/lyrics` (proxy fetch and parse full metadata serverside)
